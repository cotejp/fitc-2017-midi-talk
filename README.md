# MIDI is Staging a Comeback... In Your Browser!

These are the various code samples I presented during my [Web MIDI talk](http://fitc.ca/presentation/midi-staging-comeback-browser-2/) 
at [FITC 2017](http://fitc.ca/event/to17/) on April 23, in Toronto.

To use these examples, you need a Web MIDI-enabled browser (such as Chrome or Opera) or you need to
install the [Jazz-Plugin](http://jazz-soft.net/download/Jazz-Plugin/) (plus the 
[Jazz-MIDI extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jazz-midi/) if you are on 
Firefox v52+).
